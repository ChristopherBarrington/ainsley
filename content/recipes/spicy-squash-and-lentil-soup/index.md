servings: 6
time: 50m

ingredients:
- 2 tbsp vegetable or coconut oil
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 2 tsp coriander seeds
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1kg squash, such as Crown Prince, kabocha or butternut
- 3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped or coarsely grated
- A knob of fresh ginger, finely grated
- 1 tsp ground turmeric or 1 tbsp finely grated fresh turmeric
- 1/2 red chilli, chopped (deseeded for less heat if you prefer), or 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 150g red lentils, well rinsed
- 800ml vegetable stock
- Sea salt and black pepper

directions:
- Peel and deseed the squash, then cut into large cubes (you need about 600g prepared weight).
- Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds and the bay leaf. Fry for a few minutes until they start to sizzle
- Add the onion. As soon as it is sizzling, reduce the heat and sweat for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice.
- Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric and chilli to the onion and continue to fry gently for 3-4 minutes.
- Add the chopped squash and toss with the onion over the heat for a minute or two.
- Add the rinsed lentils to the pan.
- Pour in the stock and bring to a simmer.
- Then cover the pan and let the soup cook gently for 15-20 minutes, lifting the lid to stir regularly, until the squash is tender and the lentils have broken down into a rough pur√©e.
- Remove the bay leaf from the soup.
- Either bash and crush the squash with a wooden spoon or potato masher to get a nice rough texture, or blitz the soup until smooth, using a stick blender in the pan, or a jug blender. Add some hot water if needed to loosen the texture a little
- Season to taste with salt and pepper.
- Reheat the soup gently if necessary and ladle into warmed bowls.
- Finish, if you like, with a sprinkle of dukka and/or a trickle of olive oil, or chilli oil if you have some and fancy an extra kick of heat.

directions:
  - shawarma:
    - To make the marinade, place the onion in a food processor and process in bursts until very finely chopped. Alternatively, grate the onion on the coarse side of a box grater.
    - Transfer to a medium bowl and whisk in the Baharat, garlic, lemon zest and olive oil
    - Season the marinade well with salt and pepper then add the butternut squash, tossing to coat. Cover and place in the fridge to marinate for 15-20 minutes. Set aside if using halloumi.
    - For butternut squash, preheat the grill to the highest setting and line a rimmed baking tray with aluminium foil. Transfer the mix, as well as all the marinade to the lined baking tray, spreading out in an even layer. Place the tray under the grill and cook for 10 minutes, or until cooked
    - For halloumi, fry the halloumi on one side and turn over. Add the marinate to the pan and cook for 10-15 minutes.
    - Once cooked, squeeze over the lemon juice
    - Carve into finger-sized pieces
    - To serve, place each flatbread onto a plate and spread with the tzatziki. Top with the cooked mix, tomatoes, parsley and sumac, then roll up into a wrap.

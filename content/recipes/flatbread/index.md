servings: 2
time: 40m

ingredients:
  - 165g self raising flour
  - 20g live plain yoghurt
  - 1/4 tsp salt

directions:
  - Put the flour, yogurt and salt into a mixing bowl
  - Add 70ml tepid water, mixing to make a soft, slightly sticky dough, working it together with your fingers
  - Knead for a couple of seconds and then place the dough back into the bowl. Cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes or up to an hour.
  - Once the dough is rested, preheat a pan ready to cook the bread
  - Meanwhile, divide the dough into two equal pieces, form each piece into a ball then roll out to the size of your pan, approximately 20cm. Lightly dust the surface with some flour if needed.
  - Carefully place one flatbread into the preheated pan and cook until it puffs up and is flecked with brown spots. Turn over and cook on the other side. Repeat with the other flatbread.

- 3cm piece of fresh ginger, grated or cut into very fine matchsticks
- 2 tsp flaked seaweed, such as dulse or wakame, or mixed seaweed flakes (optional)
- 1 red chilli (the heat is up to you!), finely sliced, or a good pinch of dried chilli flakes
- 1-2 makrut lime leaves, bruised, or 1 lemongrass stem, bashed, or lemongrass trimmings (optional)
- 1 medium carrot, scrubbed or peeled and cut into matchsticks or very thin slices
- 1 medium kohlrabi or 1/2 daikon, peeled and cut into matchsticks or very thin slices (optional)
- 3-4 spring onions, finely sliced
- 1 pak choi, sliced, or a good handful of spinach leaves, roughly chopped
- 100g golden and crisp tofu or a thin two-egg omelette cut into 2cm strips
- 2 tbsp tamari or soy sauce, plus extra (optional) to finish
- Juice of 1 lime or 1/2 lemon, plus extra (optional) to finish
- A pinch of soft light brown sugar
- Sea salt and black pepper

directions:
- Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, drain well, rinse thoroughly with cold water, and drain again. Toss with the 1 tsp oil and keep ready.
- Put the stock, garlic, ginger, seaweed if using, and the chilli (fresh or dried) into a large pan.
- Add the lime leaves or lemongrass if you have either.
- Bring to a simmer, then add the carrot, and kohlrabi or daikon if using, and return to a simmer.
- Cook for a minute then add the spring onions, and sliced pak choi if using.
- Bring back to a simmer and cook for a minute to just soften the pak choi stems.
- If using spinach, add the leaves at this point, to wilt.
- You can leave the soup as it is or stir in tofu/omelette and heat through, then take off the heat.
- Stir in the tamari/soy, lime or lemon juice, sugar and some salt and pepper.
- Transfer a ladleful of the broth to a small bowl and taste - it should be hot, sour and aromatic. Add more chilli, tamari/soy, salt and/or lime or lemon juice to taste, as needed.
- Divide the noodles between warmed soup bowls and ladle over the hot soup.
- Serve at once with chopsticks and/or spoons.

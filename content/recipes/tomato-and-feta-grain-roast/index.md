servings: 4
time: 1h 10m

ingredients:
- 800g ripe tomatoes (about 9 medium), quartered or cut into chunks if very large
- 3 garlic cloves, sliced
- 1 tbsp best balsamic vinegar
- 2 tsp runny honey or maple syrup
- 4 thyme sprigs
- 4 small rosemary sprigs
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 250g cooked grains such as quinoa, wholegrain rice or spelt (these can be gluten-free)
- 400g tin chickpeas, drained
- 200g block feta cheese, drained
- good olives or capers

directions:
- Cook the grains according to instructions and set aside (these will be baked later too).
- Preheat the oven to 220C.
- Place the tomatoes, garlic, balsamic, honey, herbs and 2 tbsp of the oil in a casserole dish and season well with salt and pepper.
- Stir to combine and spread out in an even layer.
- Place in the middle of the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened and simmering juices are pooling in the bottom of the dish.
- Remove from the oven and stir the cooked grains and drained chickpeas into the tomatoes, gently and thoroughly, until evenly mixed.
- Now take the feta and break it over the surface in several large chunks and crumbles.
- Add olives/capers.
- Pour the remaining 2 tbsp of oil all over, coating the cheese.
- Move an oven rack towards the top of the oven. Place the dish on it and roast for a further 15-20 minutes, until the feta shows patches of golden crust.
- Serve hot at the table, spooned into shallow bowls.

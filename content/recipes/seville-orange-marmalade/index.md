servings: 6 jars
time: 1d 3h 30m

ingredients:
- 1kg unwaxed Waitrose Cooks' Ingredients Organic Seville Marmalade Oranges
- 1 unwaxed lemon
- 2kg preserving sugar

directions:
- Scrub all the fruit thoroughly, then dry in a clean tea towel.
- Pour 2 litres cold water into a large, wide pan or preserving pan.
- Cut the oranges and lemon in half, squeeze out the juice and add it to the water. Reserve the pips and orange shells; discard the lemon shell.
- Cut the squeezed oranges in half again and, using a metal spoon, scrape the pith and pips onto a large square of muslin. Gather up the edges and tie to form a bag. Add to the pan.
- Cut the orange peel into strips - chunky for coarse-cut marmalade or thinner for fine shred. Add to the pan, cover and leave overnight to soften.
- The next day, bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1h 30m - 2h, until the peel is very soft and the liquid has reduced by about half. Remove and discard the muslin bag, squeezing out as much liquid as possible into the pan.
- Meanwhile, [sterilise](http://waitrose.com/howtosterilisejars) 6 Ã— 340g jars 
- Put 2 saucers into the freezer to chill.
- Add the sugar to the pan and stir over a low heat until dissolved.
- Turn the heat up and boil rapidly until it reaches setting point - about 15 minutes. To test, remove the pan from the heat and spoon a little of the marmalade onto a chilled saucer. Let it cool for a few seconds, then push with a finger. If the surface wrinkles, it's ready; if not, boil for 5 minutes more and test again.
- Leave the mixture to settle for 15 minutes, then skim off any foam. Stir and pour into warm sterilised jars, then top with a waxed disc or circle of baking parchment.
- Seal when cool, then store the jars in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months. Once open, store in the fridge for up to 1 month.

servings: 6
time: 1h 30m

ingredients:
- gremolata:
    - Zest of one lemon
    - One finely chopped garlic clove
    - Finely chopped corriander leaves
- lentil soup:
  - 1 large onion, finely chopped
  - 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  - 2 tbsp finely chopped coriander stems
  - harissa paste (whole jar)
  - 200g red lentils, rinsed
  - 800ml vegetable stock
  - 400g can of tomatoes
  - squeeze of lemon (optional)
  - sea salt and black pepper

directions:
- lentil soup:
  - Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and cook it over a gentle heat until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, then stir in the coriander stems and the harissa paste.
  - Add the lentils and stir until they are coated with the paste, then pour over the stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring the stock to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer for another 10 minutes. Stir and check the consistency of the soup – add a splash more water if it seems too thick. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding a squeeze of lemon juice if you think the soup needs it.
  - Blend the soup if you want it smooth – the lentils will have broken down enough to thicken it, but there will still be some texture from the onions and tomatoes.
- gremolata:
    - Finely chop all ingredients together until well combined
    - Serve spooned over top of soup

servings: 2
time: 35m

ingredients:
- for the tofu scramble
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil
  - 1/2 medium white onion, diced
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
  - 1 (14-ounce) block firm tofu
  - 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
  - 1/2 teaspoon paprika
  - 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
  - 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- for the chili lime aioli
  - 1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise
  - 1/2 lime, juiced
  - 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
  - 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 2 tablespoons water, as needed
- to assemble the burrito bowls
  - 4 cups baby spinach, baby kale, arugula, or mixed greens
  - 2 cups cooked brown rice
  - 1/2 red onion, finely diced
  - 1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved
  - 1/2 cup canned black beans or kidney beans (optional)
  - 1/2 avocado, diced (optional)

directions:
- Scrambled tofu
  - In a nonstick pan over medium heat, add the oil and onions, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and continue to sauté for 2 more minutes.
  - Drain the tofu, but do not press it to remove excess water. Use your hands to crumble it into bite-sized pieces and add it to the pan. Use a spatula to stir the ingredients until they are evenly distributed.
  - Sprinkle in the nutritional yeast, paprika, turmeric, salt, and black pepper. Gently stir the tofu to evenly coat it with the spices. The turmeric will turn the tofu bright yellow.
  - Cook the tofu for 3 to 7 minutes, stirring every 1 to 2 minutes until the water from the tofu has evaporated. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside.
- Aioli:
  - In a small bowl, combine the vegan mayonnaise, lime juice, chili powder, garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon water until smooth. If it's still thick, add 1 more tablespoon of water to thin it out a bit more.
- Assemble the bowls
  - Divide the greens, rice, onion, tomatoes, beans, avocado, and tofu scramble between two bowls. Drizzle the aioli on top and enjoy!

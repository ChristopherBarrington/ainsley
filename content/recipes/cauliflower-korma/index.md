servings: 4
time: 30m

ingredients:
- 1 large cauliflower (about 1.2kg)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1/2 × 290g jar Patak's Mild Korma Paste
- 250ml pot Elmlea Plant Double cream alternative
- 1/4 × 25g pack coriander, leaves picked

directions:
- Preheat the grill to high.
- Cut the cauliflower into medium florets, reserving any tender leaves.
- Toss the florets and leaves with 1 1/2 tbsp oil, season with salt and spread over a large baking tray.
- Grill for 5-6 minutes, turning halfway, until just charred in places; set aside.
- Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 1/2 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat.
- Add the onion and fry for 8-10 minutes until turning golden.
- Stir in the korma paste and fry for 2 minutes, stirring regularly.
- Add the cauliflower and leaves to the pan and fry for 1 minute more, then stir in the Elmlea Plant.
- Half fill the Elmlea pot with water, add to the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.
- Scatter with coriander and serve with steamed rice or naan breads.
- A dollop of non-dairy yogurt alternative and a scattering of toasted cashews would go nicely, too.

servings: 4
time: 20m

ingredients:
- 400g can chopped/diced tomatoes
- hot water
- 1 tbsp tomato puree (tomato paste)
- 2 vegetable or chicken stock cubes (bouillon)
- olive oil
- 1 white onion, finely chopped
- 4-6 cloves garlic, finely chopped (depends on their size, and how much you like garlic!)
- 30g vermicelli noodles or spaghetti, broken into small pieces
- 200g bulgur wheat
- salt

directions:
- Pour the tomatoes into a measuring jug or bowl. Fill the empty can with hot water - add that to the tomatoes. Add the tomato puree/paste and crumble in the stock cubes. Stir together and set to one side.
- In a large heavy based pan, heat a little olive oil then gently sweat the onions and garlic until soft and translucent - about 5 minutes.
- Stir in the vermicelli and the bulgur wheat to coat in the onion and garlic mixture.
- Pour in the tomato stock and stir. Season with more salt if you need to.
- Bring to the boil and lower to a simmer for 10 minutes with the lid of the pan on. Stir from time to time to prevent the bulgur from catching on the bottom of the pan
- Switch the heat off, remove the lid and cover with a clean tea towel. Replace the lid and leave to steam.
- It is ready when the liquid is absorbed and the wheat has softened but still has a little bite to it. If you need to, you can always add more water whilst cooking.
- Can be eaten hot or cold.

time: 1h 30m

ingredients:
  - 150g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
  - 150g Littleover Apiary Pure Organic 'Wildflower' Set Honey
  - 3 eggs, separated
  - 1 unwaxed lemon, zest
  - 200g ground almonds
  - 100g polenta
  - 1.5 tsp baking powder
  - 0.5 tsp salt
  - 3 tbsp lemon thyme leaves, plus extra for decorating
  - Vanilla cream:
    - 100g double cream
    - ~100g natural yogurt~
    - 0.5 tsp vanilla bean paste
  - Honey lemon syrup:
    - 75g Littleover Apiary
    - Pure Organic 'Wildflower' Set Honey
    - 0.5 unwaxed lemon, juice

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 170C, gas mark 3; lightly grease and line the base and sides of a 20cm cake tin.
  - In a large mixing bowl, use an electric hand mixer to cream the butter and honey together until light and fluffy.
  - Beat in the egg yolks and lemon zest, then the almonds, polenta, baking powder, salt and thyme leaves.
  - In a separate, clean bowl, using clean beaters, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks.
  - Gently fold into the polenta mixture, being careful to retain as much air as possible but making sure all the egg white is mixed in.
  - Pour into the cake tin and bake for 40-50 minutes until golden and cooked through (cover loosely with a sheet of foil after 30 minutes if it browns too quickly).
  - Cool the cake for 15 minutes in the tin, then remove and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.
  - When ready to serve, whisk the double cream to very soft peaks, then whisk in the ~yogurt and~ vanilla bean paste; set aside.
  - Heat the syrup ingredients in a small pan until bubbling, then pour over the cake.
  - Top with extra thyme leaves, slice and serve with the vanilla cream.

Vicky was not so sure that yoghurt was a good addition, better just vanilla cream or less yoghurt.

Depending on your oven and how many cake tins you use, the cooking time will vary

1 deep-sided 20cm spring-form cake tin at 160C will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes. Check the cake regularly after 40 minutes, covering the top with foil if it starts to brown too much around the edges.

You can divide the mixture equally into 2 x 20cm shallow cake tins and cook for less time at 160C, approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Check the cake regularly after 30 minutes, covering the top of the cakes with foil if they have started to brown too much around the edges.

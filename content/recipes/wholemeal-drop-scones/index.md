servings: 12-15
time: 25m

ingredients:
- 250g fine plain wholemeal flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- A pinch of salt
- 15g golden caster sugar
- 2 medium eggs
- Up to 200ml milk
- 50g butter, melted
- Vegetable oil, for frying

directions:
- Put the flour into a large bowl with the baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and sugar and whisk together well.
- Make a well in the centre and break in the eggs, then pour in about 150ml of the milk. Start whisking the eggs and milk together in the middle of the bowl, gradually drawing in the flour as you do so.
- When you have a thick paste, whisk in the melted butter, then keep whisking, gradually adding dashes of milk, until you have a batter with a consistency a little thicker than double cream, but thinner than a cake batter.
- If you want to keep the drop scones warm once cooked, set the oven to a low heat (around 80C). Alternatively, just hand them out as soon as they are ready.
- You will need to cook the batter in 3 or 4 batches. Put a large, heavy-based frying pan or griddle over a medium heat. When hot, add a scant teaspoonful of oil and brush it over the bottom of the pan.
- Spoon a generous tablespoonful of batter into the pan and let it spread out, then repeat with a few more tablespoonfuls, as many as you can fit comfortably into the pan.
- After about a minute, little bubbles will start to appear on the surface of the scones. As soon as they cover the surface, flip the scones over with a spatula.
- Cook the drop scones for a minute or so until golden brown on the other side and firm to the touch. If they are looking bit pale, give them a bit longer on each side.
- Then transfer to a dish and put into the low oven, if you like.
- If your first drop scones are spreading too much, whisk a little extra shake of flour into the batter. If they are a bit fat and cakey, add a dash more milk.
- Cook the remaining batter in the same way, adjusting the temperature as necessary if the pan starts to get too hot and the drop scones are browning too fast, and adding a drop more oil now and again between batches.

title: English onion soup
summary: The long, slow cooking of the onions to sweet, melting tenderness is a labour of love, but it's well worth it.

servings: 4
time: 2h

ingredients:
- Soup
  - 1kg onions
  - 40g unsalted butter, or 3 tbsp olive or vegetable oil
  - 3 garlic cloves, sliced
  - 1 bay leaf
  - A sprig of thyme
  - 100ml red wine
  - 1 tbsp tamari or soy sauce
  - 800ml hot vegetable stock
  - Sea salt and black pepper
  - 50g strong cheese, such as gruy√®re, cheddar or parmesan, grated (optional)
- Herb croutons
  - 2 thick slices of wholemeal bread, cut into chunks
  - A small bunch of sage, rosemary or thyme, leaves picked and roughly chopped
  - 2 tbsp olive or vegetable oil

directions:
- Herb croutons
  - Preheat the oven to 150C.
  - Toss the cubes of bread with the chopped herbs and oil.
  - Spread out in an oven dish and bake for about 10 minutes until crisp and golden.
  - Set aside.
- Soup
  - Slice the onions very thinly (using a mandoline or food processor is the speediest way to do this).
  - Heat the butter or oil in a large saucepan or deep, wide frying pan, over a medium-low heat.
  - Add the sliced onions with some salt and pepper. As soon as they are sizzling, turn down the heat, cover the pan and let them sweat for 45-60 minutes until soft, silky and significantly reduced in volume, lifting the lid to stir them fairly often.
  - Uncover the pan, add the garlic, turn up the heat a little and cook for another 15-30 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are very soft, wilted and golden. Don't let them catch or burn at any point.
  - Add the bay leaf and thyme, wine and tamari/soy and simmer until the liquid is reduced to almost nothing, around 3 minutes.
  - Add the stock, bring to a simmer and cook gently for another 10 minutes.
  - Season to taste with salt and pepper (you can add a dash more tamari/soy too - but be restrained as you don't want the soup to actually taste of either).
  - Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and top with the herb croutons.
  - Add a sprinkle of grated cheese to each bowl, if you like, and serve.

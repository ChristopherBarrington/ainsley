ingredients:
- makes 4x 8oz jars
- 1 cup packed fresh rosemary leaves
- 1 cup coarse salt, such as sea salt

directions:
- Put the rosemary leaves and coarse salt in a food processor.

- Spread out on a baking sheet to dry for a few hours.
- Transfer to 4 (8-ounce) jars with tight-fitting lids. It keeps indefinitely for use in your favorite recipes.

- Carefully (using a clean tea towel to protect your hands), cut open the potatoes and scoop out the flesh into a large mixing bowl.
- Add the remaining 2 tbsp oil and 1/2 of the cheddar. 
- Mash together and season.
- Spoon over the lentil mix.
- Scatter with the remaining cheese.
- Bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
- Pop under the grill briefly to brown the top a little more, if liked.

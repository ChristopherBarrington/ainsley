- Return the pan to the heat and raise to high.
- Add the broccoli (etc) and a couple of pinches of salt and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, until starting to soften and appear charred in places.
- Finish the cooking by splashing a little water (2-3 tbsp in the pan and stir until evaporated. The broccoli should be bright green and just tender. Remove from the heat.

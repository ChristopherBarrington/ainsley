servings: 6
time: 1h 30m

ingredients:
- 1.2-1.5kg ripe, flavoursome tomatoes (any size or kind, or a mix) or 3 x 400g tins plum tomatoes
- 1 medium onion, finely sliced
- 1-2 tender inner celery sticks, finely sliced
- 1 medium carrot, scrubbed or peeled and thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, thickly sliced
- A couple of bay leaves
- A sprig of thyme (optional)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp soured cream or half-fat crème fraîche, plus extra (optional) to serve
- 200-500ml hot vegetable stock
- Sea salt and black pepper
- Chopped parsley or chives, to finish (optional)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 170C.
- Halve the tomatoes (little cherry ones can stay whole) and put them into your largest roasting tray with all the other prepared veg, garlic and herbs.
- Season with salt and pepper and trickle over the olive oil.
- Toss well to coat everything in the oil and seasoning.
- Roast in the oven, stirring the veg every 20 minutes or so, until the tomatoes are completely soft, pulpy and starting to colour, and the carrot feels tender when tested with the point of a knife (it doesn't need to be soft).
- If you have a huge oven tray and a very efficient oven, it might be done in 45 minutes; with a more compact tray and a less punchy oven, it may take an hour or longer.
- Remove and discard the bay and thyme, if used, then transfer the contents of the tray to a jug blender.
- Blitz thoroughly to a smooth, velvety purée. A powerful blender should take care of the tomato skins and pips but if yours won't break them down completely, rub the purée through a big sieve to remove them.
- Pour the soup into a pan. Add the soured cream or crème fraiche and just enough hot stock to get a thick but slurpable consistency.
- Taste to check the seasoning and reheat gently.
- Serve in warmed bowls, topped with a creamy swirl if you like, and a sprinkling of chopped parsley or chives if you have some.

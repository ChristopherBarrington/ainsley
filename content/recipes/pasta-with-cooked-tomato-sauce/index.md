servings: 4
time: 45m

ingredients:
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 bay leaves
- 2-3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced or coarsely grated
- 2 Ã— 400g tins plum tomatoes
- A pinch of brown sugar (optional)
- A pinch of dried chilli flakes (optional)
- Sea salt and black pepper
- 300g wholewheat pasta of your choice
- A trickle of olive oil
- Finely grated parmesan or cheddar (optional)

directions:
- Heat the olive oil in a large, wide heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat.
- Add the bay leaves and garlic and let them sizzle and spit until the garlic is just starting to turn golden.
- Add the tomatoes to the pan with their juice - they will spit as they hit the hot oil, but they soon calm down.
- Rinse out each tin out with a little water so you get all the tomato juice, and add this too.
- Add a pinch of salt and some pepper.
- Bring the sauce to a simmer, using a potato masher or a fork to crush the tomatoes in the pan so they start to break down.
- Simmer the sauce, stirring fairly frequently, and crushing any larger chunks with your spoon, for 25-30 minutes, or until reduced by about one-third and tasting rich and intense.
- Any obvious bits of Skin, or the whitish fibrous ends of the tomatoes that won't break down, can be removed with a fork.
- The acidity will mellow and the sweetness increase as the sauce cooks, but you can add a pinch of sugar if you like.
- Taste to check the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper only if needed.
- If you'd like a little heat, add a pinch of chill flakes.
- Remove the bay leaves.
- Blitz it until smooth with a stick or jug blender if you prefer it like that.
- Bring a large pan of water to the bail, add salt and then the pasta
- Cook until al dente (tender but firm to the bite), drain and return to the hot pan. Add the hot tomato sauce and stir well.
- Serve the pasta in tomato sauce just as it is with a trickle of olive oil and some freshly ground salt and pepper on top or add a grating of cheese.

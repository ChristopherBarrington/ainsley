servings: 12
time: 20m

ingredients:
- 30g whole, skin-on almonds or hazelnuts, roughly chopped or bashed
- 30g cashew nuts or peanuts, roughly chopped or bashed
- 30g pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds or a mix
- 2 tsp cumin or caraway seeds
- 2 tsp coriander seeds
- A good pinch of flaky salt
- A few twists of black pepper
- A small pinch of dried chill flakes
- A sprig of mint, leaves picked and finely chopped, to finish (optional)

directions:
- Put a small, heavy-based frying pan over a medium-high heat.
- Add the nuts and pumpkin/sunflower seeds to the pan and toast them for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan regularly so they take on some even colour.
- While the seeds and nuts are toasting, lightly crush all the spice seeds using a pestle and mortar - breaking rather than grinding the spices; leaving a few whole seeds is fine. Add these to the pan of nuts and seeds, along with the salt, pepper and chilli flakes.
- Continue to heat for 2-3 minutes, moving or turning the mix now and then, to toast the nuts and spices until well coloured (keeping a close eye on them because they can burn quite easily). 
- Tip out onto a plate and set aside to cool.
- You can use the dukka immediately or store in it an airtight container for a week or so. Adding some finely chopped fresh mint when you serve up the dukka is a lovely touch. Just stir it through the dukka before sprinkling.
- To serve as a 'dry dip', simply put a bowl of dukka on the table with torn bread and good oil.

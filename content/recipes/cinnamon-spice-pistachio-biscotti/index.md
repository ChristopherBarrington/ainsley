time: 40m

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 large eggs at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- pinch of ground cloves
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup shelled chopped unsalted pistachios
- 1/3 cup cinnamon chips (optional)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy.
- Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt.
- Stir in the butter mixture, then add the pistachios and cinnamon chips.
- Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface, then knead gently with your hands until the dough is smooth.
- Divide the dough in half, and shape each into a 12-inch log.
- Arrange the logs onto the prepared pan and then bake them for about 35 to 40 minutes until lightly browned and just firm to the touch.
- Cool 15 minutes, then move to a cutting boar and use a serrated knife to cut each log into 1/2-inch thick slices.
- Lay the slices flat on the baking sheet, then return to the oven and bake an additional 20 minutes.
- The cookies will firm up as they cool.
- Remove from the oven and cool completely.
- In small heat-proof bowl, melt white chocolate in microwave at 60 percent power for 1 minute.
- Stir until smooth. If not completely melted, continue to microwave in 10 second intervals, being careful not to scorch.
- Use a fork, to drizzle melted chocolate over cooled cookies.

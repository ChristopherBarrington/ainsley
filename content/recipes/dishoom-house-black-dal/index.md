servings: 4
time: 4h 30m

ingredients:
  - 150g urad dal
  - 2+ litres cold water
  - 6g garlic paste
  - 6g ginger paste
  - 35g tomato puree
  - 4g fine sea salt
  - 1/3 tsp deggi mirch chilli powder
  - 1/3 tsp garam masala
  - 45g unsalted butter
  - 45ml cocunut milk (or double cream)

directions:
  - Thoroughly rinse urad dal
  - Cover with water in large saucepan (this will be drained later)
  - Bring dal to boil and cook steadily for 2-3 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to surface
  - Dal grains become soft with skins coming away from white grains which should become creamy
  - When cooked, drain and set aside for 15 min
  - Mix the spices into a paste
  - Replace cooking water for dal with freshly boiled water to cover by 3-4cm and bring to a boil
  - Add aromatic paste and butter and cook rapidly for 30 min, stirring regularly
  - Simmer for 1-1.5 hours, stirring regularly (add a little more water as required)
  - Eventually, the dal will turn thick and creamy. The creaminess must come from the grains disintegrating into the liquid and enriching it, not from the water being allowed to evaporate, leaving only the grains behind.
  - Add the cream and cook for a further 15 minutes
  - Serve with chapatis or other Indian breads
  - When reheating any leftover dal, you may need to add a little more liquid; use cream or cream and water, rather than just water alone.

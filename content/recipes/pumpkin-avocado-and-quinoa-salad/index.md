Packaged pre-cooked quinoa is fine for this recipe. If cooking from dry, don't fall for any recommendation to rinse the quinoa first or you will not get a light and fluffy result. The key is to toast the dry grains before cooking. First get your quantities right.

The best ratio of cooking liquid to quinoa is 2:1, so measure the volume of quinoa in a measuring jug (say 100 ml) and then be prepared to add twice that amount of stock or water (200 ml). Heat up a lidded pan over a medium heat without oil, and toss in the dry quinoa. Stir it around for just a couple of minutes until it pops and emits a bit of a toasty fragrance then add the liquid. Stir, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 13-15 minutes, then fluff to perfection.
